# Udacity Project: Landmark Detection &amp; Tracking (SLAM)

This project is an implementation of the Linear Graph SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) method for a 2 dimensional world. We can create a map of the environment of the robot through the combination of motion and sensor data that was gathered over time.
